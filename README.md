# Overview
Welcome to my final project. The purpose of this project is to classify whether or not an image was taken during night or day.

# Directions
1. Take the code from this github, and download/copy it to your coding engine.
2. Use this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stevemark/daynight-dataset to find similar images to the one I used in my dataset
3. Take any of the images and run the command "python3 dayornight.py (directory)/image.jpg
